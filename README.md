# Extended Kalman Filter Implementation #

To run build and run the code go to `src/` and run `./start.sh`

### Things to remember:
Rescaling of theta (radar measurement) and y(1) (radar theta measurement update) to be within -pi to pi.

### Results
RMSE < [.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52] for both the datasets
